# SHPE UH Website

The official website for the **Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) — University of Houston** chapter. A full-stack web application for managing chapter membership, events, committees, and internal communications.

## Features

- **Authentication** — Secure sign-up and login with JWT tokens and Argon2 password hashing
- **Events Calendar** — Public calendar displaying upcoming chapter events
- **Email Reminders** — Members can request an email reminder for any upcoming event (sent 24h before, handled by a background loop)
- **Dashboard** — Personalized member dashboard with upcoming events and notifications
- **Committees** — Browse, join, and leave committees; chairs and co-chairs can view rosters and broadcast messages to members
- **Notifications** — In-app notification system for committee activity (joins, messages)
- **Gallery** — Photo gallery with an approval workflow
- **Points** — Member points tracking

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React 19, React Router v7
- Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion
- Axios

**Backend**
- FastAPI, SQLModel (SQLAlchemy 2), SQLite
- PyJWT, pwdlib (Argon2), Pydantic v2, Uvicorn
- pytest + httpx for the test suite

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ and npm
- **Python** 3.11+
- **Git**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd shpe-uh-website
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env` (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)):

```bash
echo "SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30" > .env
```

Then seed and run:

```bash
# Seed the database with committees, chairs, and test data (run once)
python seed.py

# Start the development server
python main.py
# or: uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at **http://localhost:8000**. Interactive API docs at **http://localhost:8000/docs**.

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create the environment file
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env.local

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at **http://localhost:5173**.

## Environment Variables

### `backend/.env`

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Random hex secret for JWT signing | `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `ALGORITHM` | Yes | JWT signing algorithm | `HS256` |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | Yes | Token lifetime in minutes | `30` |
| `SMTP_HOST` | No | SMTP server for reminder emails. **Unset = dev mode:** emails print to the console instead | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | No | SMTP port | `587` |
| `SMTP_USER` | No | Sender address / SMTP login | `chapter@example.org` |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | No | SMTP password (use an app password for Gmail) | — |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | No | From header; defaults to `SMTP_USER` | `SHPE UH <noreply@example.org>` |

### `frontend/.env.local`

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend base URL | `http://localhost:8000` |

> **Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` to version control.**

## Seeded Accounts

`python seed.py` creates a test member, all 14 committees, and their chairs/co-chairs (22 chair accounts). All seeded accounts use the password `password123`.

| Account | Email | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Test member | `test@cougarnet.uh.edu` | Member |
| Committee chairs | `<first>.<last>@cougarnet.uh.edu` (e.g. `angel.montoya@cougarnet.uh.edu`) | Chair of their committee |

The full chair roster lives in `backend/seed.py` (`COMMITTEE_ROSTER`).

> **Note:** if you reseed (`rm database.db && python seed.py`) while the backend is running, restart it — the server keeps a handle to the old database file and will serve stale data.

## Committees & Chairs

Committees support **co-chairs** — a committee can have one or two chairs, and every chair:

- Appears as a contact (name + email) on the committee card
- Can view the member roster and broadcast messages
- Is notified when a member joins

Chair permissions are tied to the user's `Role` (e.g. `academic_chair`) matching the committee's `chair_role`, plus an `is_chair` membership row. Both are set up by the seed.

## Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/
```

Tests run against an in-memory SQLite database (no setup needed) using fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`.
